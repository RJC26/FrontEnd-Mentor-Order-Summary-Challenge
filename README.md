# FrontEnd-Mentor-Order-Summary-Challenge

This is my attempt at the Order Summary challenge on FrontEnd mentor, I found this to be slighty annoying only due to the background when switching to a mobile size viewport. Like always it was one simple line i missed with an error which caused so much confusion! 
Got there in the end but if you have any advice or improvements please comment over at forn end mentor!
